1. Task List: Display a list of tasks, each with a checkbox to mark them as completed.

2. Add Task: Allow users to add new tasks to the list.

3. Edit Task: Allow users to edit the text of an existing task.

4. Delete Task: Allow users to remove tasks from the list.

5. Filter Tasks: Implement filters to show all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks.
